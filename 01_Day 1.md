## Vulnerability management 
* Process of defining, identifying, classifying and prioritizing vulnerabilities in computer systems, applications and network infrastructures.
* an organized approach to scanning and continuous assessment of your organizational security posture.


Vulnerability Management Lifecycle
1) **Discover** - Proper discovery procedures using automated tools allow for accurate accounting of network connected devices and their functions.
2) **Prioritize** - This step is directly related to identifying high-priority systems, which typically are externally facing, lack fault tolerance, or store sensitive information such as customer data, Personally Identifiable Information (PII), or Protected Health Information (PHI).
3) **Assess** - The assessment step involves enumerating vulnerabilities through automated scans. To have a successful vulnerability management program you must continuously ensure breadth and depth of these scans.
4) **Report** - It is important to know your audience when building these reports. At least three different reports should be built from each Assess phase.
5) **Remediate** : A good starting point would be to remediate Highs within 30 days - which means before your next monthly scan; Moderates within 90 days; and Lows when time allows, 365 days maximum.
6) **Verify** - During this step we confirm that remediation efforts have succeeded. Rescanning with the same breadth and depth is critical to ensuring that vulnerabilities are no longer present in the environment. After this verification, tickets should be closed and saved for future reference

**Standardizing Vulnerabilities**

* Vulnerability Management Used To Be Performed By Numerous Different Types Of Software With No Common Protocol
* Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) Led By NIST Standardized Vulnerability Management Between Different Software
https://scap.nist.gov
NIST SP 800-117
Guide To Adopting And Using The SCAP


SCAP
* Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE)
++ standard names for system configuration issues
* Common Platform Enumeration (CPE)
++ standard names for product names and versions
* Common Vulnerabilities And Exposures (CVE)
++ standard names for security-related software flaws
* Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
++ standard approach for severity of software flaws
* Ext
